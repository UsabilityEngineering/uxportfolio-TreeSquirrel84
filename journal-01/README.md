First Journal Entry - Steam Interface
Warren Rose II - 2/23/20

In order to play some co-operative computer games with online friends I decided to use Valve's Steam service to purchase three copies of a game.  Finding the right type of game was slightly buggy as the interface provided for searching the store's database with tags required the tags to be retyped each time the search page was reloaded after calling up the individual page for each game.  Deleting tags and entering new ones into the search box sometimes resulted in 'invisible' tags persisting, narrowing the search field unnecessarily with no way to correct for this until the page was reloaded.  This method of searching proved to not be very **error tolerant** as mistyped words or missed clicks by the user could sometimes cascade for little apparent reason, while a more error tolerant system would have proved much more forgiving.

Once I had decided on a game, using the system's preferred method of sending a copy to someone on my Friend's list was a simple procedure of picking their name and icon from a list that helpfully showed whether or not they already had the game.  There was also a mandatory greeting card style text message form to fill out.

The second game copy I decided to have my friend purchase themselves by supplying them with a Steam Gift Card.  This was as simple as typing Steam Gift Card into the search bar and picking from a list of options.  This was very **memorable** but had taken me some effort to track down the first time I used the interface.  Also this was a slightly **inefficient** method as the cards are only available in $5, $10, $25 denominations with little choice to send exact values.

The third game copy I had hopes of sending using the Game Key which is a series of letters and numbers that the Steam service can read in order to unlock a game into someone's library.  However, Steam had disabled this convenient option in its own store so I purchased the key using a third-party service called HumbleBundle and sent the code to them by text message on my phone.

In general, I was satisfied by my experience with the system, although I found some bits to be counter-intuitive.
